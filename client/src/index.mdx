# Welcome

I've gone through many technical interviews and have always scrambled the week before to re-memorize the popular algorithms and data structures that
are usually involved in these tests. I wanted to create a place where I can write down the points that I think are important, all in javascript
since that is my favorite language. With this style of study guide I can also write javascript logic and actually execute and test various scenarios, so there's even
more to this study guide than what you see here. you can check out the source code on my Github and see some algorithms at work.

Enjoy!
