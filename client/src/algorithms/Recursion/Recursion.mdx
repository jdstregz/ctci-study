# Recursion

Recursion is a specific way of solving a problem, and can usually be applied to problems that require diving
through to compute a problem on the nth of an item, usually by mutating the solution of the n-1 problem.

Recursive problems are space intensive, since every recursive call adds a new layer to the stack. Every recursive
solution has at least O(n) space complexity.

## Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming means to use a recursive algorithm, find the overlapping subproblems (repeated calls on the same item),
and to cache those results for future calls.

Here is an example of a recursive solution vs a dynamic programming solution to the fibonnaci numbers problem:

```javascript
const fibonacci = (n) => {
    if (i == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (i == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    return fibonacci(i - 1) + fibonacci(i - 2);
}
```
The above solution definitely works, but it costs a lot of time: O(2^n)

With some memoization added, we can make the function cache the results so that future fibonacci calls
don't have to go through the same steps:

```javascript
const fibonacci = (n) => {
    const memo = {};
    const recursiveFib = (i) => {
        if (i == 0 || i == 1) {
            return i;
        }
        if (memo[i] == null) {
            memo[i] = recursiveFib(i - 1) + recursiveFib(i - 2);
        }
        return memo[i];
    }
    return recursiveFib(n);
}
```

We can actually show the time it takes to solve these problems:

I literally can't do more than fib(41) because the recursive answer takes too long and my computer crashes...

### Bottom Up vs Top Down
The above dynamic programming implementation is an example of top down, where we start at the top of the chain and
solve downwards towards n = 0. Bottom up is the opposite:

```javascript
const fib = (n) => {
    if (n === 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    let a = 0;
    let b = 1;
    for (let i = 2; i < n; i +=1) {
        let c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
    return a + b;
}
```
