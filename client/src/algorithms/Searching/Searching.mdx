## Depth-First Search

- DFS is a searching algorithms we can use on graph-like data structures. Sometimes the problems are purely graphical
and sometimes they can present themselves as a matrix. Trees fall into this category as well.
- When we search for something using DFS, we search as deep as we can in the chain of linked nodes before moving onto
the next path.

```javascript
// This is what we would like to do if it was a tree, and we know that the deeper we go we arent
// going to repeat ourselves
const dfs = (node) => {
    if (node == null) {
        return;
    }
    console.log(node.val);
    dfs(node.left);
    dfs(node.right);
}

// Here's the case just to make sure we don't revisit nodes in the case of a cyclical graph
const graphFriendlyDFS = (node) => {
    if (node == null) {
        return;
    }
    console.log(node.val);
    node.visited = true;
    for (const child of node.children) {
        if (!child.visited) {
            graphFriendlyDFS(child);
        }
    }
}
```
So given this tree:
<Tree/>
Here's the output we would receive from dfs:
<DFS/>

## Breadth-First Search
- BFS is another searching algorithm for graphs. Instead of diving as deep as we can to search first, we make sure
we are queueing up everything level by level.

```javascript
const bfs = (root) => {
    const queue = [];
    queue.push(root);
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const node = queue.shift();
        if (!node) {
            continue;
        }
        console.log(node.val);
        queue.push(node.left);
        queue.push(node.right);
    }
}

// you can add logic to remember which nodes you've visited to prevent any unwanted cyclical behavior;
```

For the same tree above, the following is the output we would receive:
<BFS/>

## Binary Search

Binary search is a way to search through a list of sorted items. We keep grabbing the midpoint to check if it is
greater than or less than our target. We then look for the midpoint in the half that must contian our target.

```javascript
const binarySearch = (arr, target) => {
    let low = 0;
    let high = arr.length - 1;
    let mid;
    while (low <= high) {
        mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        if (arr[mid] < target) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else if (arr[mid] > target) {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            return mid;
        }
    }
    return -1; // couldn't find it
}
```
